# Kiro Project Documentation

## Overview
This folder documents how **Kiro IDE** was used during the development of the
**Smart Research Assistant for Earth and Ocean Sciences**.

Kiro was used not only as a development environment, but as a **planning and
decision-making tool** to define project scope, system structure, and responsible
AI usage.

---

## Purpose of Using Kiro

Kiro IDE was chosen to support:
- Clear requirement definition before coding
- Modular system design
- Controlled feature scope during a hackathon
- Responsible and explainable AI integration

Using Kiro helped ensure that implementation decisions were guided by
well-defined specifications rather than ad-hoc development.

## Specifications

All key project requirements and design decisions are documented in the
specs/requirements.md file.

This file captures:

The problem definition we started with

The goals and boundaries of the project

The system structure and responsibilities of each component

Important design choices, such as keeping data analysis separate from AI

Clear acceptance criteria used to validate the solution
