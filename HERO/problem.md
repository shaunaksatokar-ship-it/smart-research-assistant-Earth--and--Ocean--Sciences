Problem

Earth and Ocean science datasets are large, complex, and technical, which makes them difficult for students and early researchers to explore and understand. Existing tools either show raw data without guidance or use AI that gives answers without explanation, making it hard to trust or learn from the results.

Solution

We built a Smart Research Assistant that keeps scientific analysis accurate and transparent while making insights easier to understand. The backend handles all data analysis, and the AI is used only to explain verified results in simple language, helping users learn what the data says and why.
