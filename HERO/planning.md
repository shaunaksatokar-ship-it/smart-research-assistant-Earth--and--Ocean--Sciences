Planning Approach

Before starting the implementation, we focused on planning the system clearly. We defined the problem, fixed the scope, and decided early what each part of the system should do. This helped us avoid confusion later and kept everyone aligned. Planning also helped us make responsible choices, especially about how AI should be used, so the project stayed clean, structured, and meaningful.
